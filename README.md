## 🏠 Residential Billing Rates

| Units Consumed (m³) | Rate per m³ | FCDA   | Tax  |
|---------------------|-------------|--------|------|
| ≤ 20                | ₱12.60      | 1.0%   | 2.0% |
| 21 – 30             | ₱13.75      | 2.0%   | 2.0% |
| 31 – 40             | ₱14.95      | 3.0%   | 2.0% |
| 41 – 50             | ₱16.30      | 3.0%   | 2.0% |
| > 50                | ₱17.95      | 10.0%  | 2.0% |

- **Penalty (after due date):** 10% of the total bill

## 🏢 Commercial Billing Rates

| Units Consumed (m³) | Formula                       |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| ≤ 50                | `units × ₱12.60`              |
| ≤ 100               | `₱25 + (units − 5) × ₱3`     |
| ≤ 150               | `₱50 + (units − 10) × ₱5`    |
| ≤ 200               | `₱75 + (units − 15) × ₱7`    |
| > 200               | `₱150 + (units − 20) × ₱9`   |

- **Late payment rate:** Total bill × 2.5

## 📁 Project Structure

```
billing-system/
│
└── billing.c       # Main source file (login, residential, commercial logic)
```

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- Login credentials are hardcoded (not secure for production use)
- Customer details (name, address, billing month) are hardcoded — not entered dynamically
- Uses `goto` statements (not recommended in modern C; consider refactoring with loops)
- No file I/O — billing records are not saved between sessions
- Password stored and compared as a plain integer

---

## 🚀 Possible Improvements

- Dynamic customer data input (name, address, billing month)
- Secure password handling
- File-based record keeping (save/load billing history)
- Replace `goto` with proper loop structures
- Input validation for non-numeric entries
